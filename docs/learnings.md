Short notes when something went wrong or was surprising. Newest on top.

- 2026-11-08: A* bug: diagonal neighbours wrapped around the map edge (x = -1 became the previous row). Always check x and y bounds separately, never only the flat index.
- 2026-11-08: typescript-eslint 8.72 supports TypeScript only up to 6.0. TypeScript 7 is not used yet.
- 2026-11-08: `structuredClone` is a DOM/Node API, not plain ES2022. The sim uses a JSON clone instead.
